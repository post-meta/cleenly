## CONTENT STYLE NOTES

1. **No clichés:**
- NOT "professional cleaning team"
- NOT "sparkling results"
- NOT "we care about your home"
- NOT "dedicated professionals"

2. **Write directly:**
- "You see the price before you book" instead of "Transparent pricing"
- "We'll send someone to fix it" instead of "100% satisfaction guaranteed"

3. **Be specific:**
- Numbers where possible ($140-$170, 2-3 hours)
- Examples of areas (Bellevue, Kirkland)
- Specific actions (dusting, vacuuming, mopping)

4. **Tone:**
- Like explaining to a friend
- Confident but not aggressive
- Helpful, not pushy
