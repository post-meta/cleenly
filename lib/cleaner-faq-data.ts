    question: "Is it really free to join?",
    answer:

    question: "How much can I earn?",
    answer:
      "Depends on your rates, how many hours you work, and the jobs you accept. Most cleaners on CLEENLY earn $25-45 per hour after our fee. Top cleaners with great reviews earn more.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I set my prices?",
    answer:
      "You set your own hourly rate or per-job pricing. We show you what similar cleaners charge to help you decide. You can adjust your rates anytime. Customers see your rate before booking.",

  {
    question: "What if a customer cancels?",
    answer:
      "If a customer cancels less than 24 hours before the appointment, they're charged a cancellation fee — and you get a portion of it. We protect your time.",

    question: "Do I need my own supplies?",

  {
    question: "Do I need insurance?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "What's the background check?",
    answer:
      "We use a third-party service to check criminal history and verify identity. It takes 2-5 business days. This is standard for home services and protects both you and customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I also work for other platforms?",
    answer:

  {
    question: "How fast can I start getting bookings?",
