## City Intro

House cleaning in Seattle, Washington. We clean Craftsman homes in Ballard, modern skinny houses in Capitol Hill, and apartments across dense neighborhoods from Fremont to Columbia City. Seattle's older housing stock needs careful attention — original fixtures, clawfoot tubs, softwood floors. We know what we're dealing with.

## Regular Cleaning

Regular cleaning in Seattle costs $100-$200 for most homes. We clean classic Craftsman homes, modern skinny homes, and apartments in neighborhoods from Ballard to Beacon Hill. Seattle homes deal with urban soot, moisture-prone bathrooms, and dust that settles in tight spaces. Our regular cleaning handles the basics so you don't have to. Serving Capitol Hill, Fremont, Queen Anne, University District, West Seattle, Columbia City, Wallingford, Green Lake, and more.

## Deep Cleaning

Deep cleaning in Seattle costs $150-$300 for most homes. We get into baseboards, window tracks, inside appliances, and the corners that regular cleaning skips. Seattle's older homes collect grime in places you forget about — behind radiators, under claw-foot tubs, in original built-ins. We clean them properly. Amazon and healthcare workers who value their free time over scrubbing floors book deep cleaning when things have gotten away from them.

## Move-Out Cleaning

Move-out cleaning in Seattle costs $200-$400 depending on size and condition. We clean to landlord inspection standards — inside cabinets, appliances, closets, window tracks, and walls spot-cleaned. Seattle rentals often have older features that need detailed attention. We help you get your deposit back. Serving all Seattle neighborhoods from Ballard to Rainier Valley.
